Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder. The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud. Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage. He loops the rope around a twisted pipe. Big Geek is hauling ass away from him. The line snap taut an instant later. The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go. The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot. Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining. As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls. The big arm extends menacingly. The smaller from manipulators open. An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. The big machine roars forward. Straight at Bud. Bud gets his knot partly done. See Flatbed looming. Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet. One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over. Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework. K-CRUUUNCH!!

DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip. The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. BUD has gotten himself into a bad position. Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck. Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic. There's no cover, side to side, up or down. Coffey has him head in his lights. Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey. He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle. At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab. Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below. They resolve into NTI ships. Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with at the Montana wreck. The larger manta-ships. And others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish. Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.

The car races swiftly towards the curve, getting closer and closer. But at such high speed it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn.

On a calm sea, amid the Aeolian Isles, just off the coast of Sicily, a motor yacht is moving quietly and smoothly over the water. It is heading directly towards a small island that appears like a huge rock jutting up from the sea, sharply silhouetted against the sky, about a hundred yards away. A few sea gulls are lazily wheeling around up above. Aboard the yacht, a sailor is at the helm, peacefully smoking his pipe, while another peers out over the water as he munches on a sandwich. It is almost noon. Raimondo, a deeply bronzed young man in his thirties, is lying outstretched in the sun on top of the cabin. Towards the prow, lying flat on her stomach upon a small rubber mat, is Claudia. Her arms are dangling over the side of the boat, catching the cool, fine spray of water splashing gently against the prow. Corrado comes out of the cabin. He sits down on a bench near the stern after placing a cushion under himself so as not to soil his suit, which is white and of an elegance that is slightly out of style.

Sandro comes out of his room and walks along through the corridors, heading towards the reception halls down at the other end. Other persons are walking up and down the corridor in both directions. Sandro's attention is attracted by the figure of a woman who is coming his way at a rather quick pace. She is wrapped in a tight-fitting evening dress that emphasizes the various harmonious parts of her body. Sandro looks at her. He seems to recognize her but isn't quite sure who it is. The girl passes alongside of him and apparently she too has the same impression, for she gives him a look that lasts much longer than it normally would between two complete strangers. She stops in front of a door but before entering, she casts another glance at Sandro, who suddenly recalls that she is the same woman who had almost provoked a riot in the streets of Messina and who was forced to take refuge in a men's shop.

I'm sick and tired of being like that. Claudia gets up and leaves the room. She continues walking down along the corridor, checking here and there. But the hotel is deserted. There are still a few lights on in the reception hall but not enough to illuminate the place adequately. Finally, she reaches the main hall and stops. The only signs of last night's party is a certain disorder in the placement of the armchairs and ashtrays filled with cigarette butts. Even the main hall seems completely deserted. But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room. She takes a few steps, walking silently over the thick carpet, so as to get a better look. There seems to be a slight movement among what appears to be a jumbled pile of male and female clothes, partly hidden from view by the back of the sofa. Claudia goes up still closer because she is not able to see clearly what or who it is. Only that she has the impression of having seen that suit before... A man's suit. She is now able to distinguish what it is: a couple embracing and kissing. Claudia approaches still closer. She is now just a few steps away. Little by little, as she advances, her face takes on such a painful look of astonishment that she appears almost petrified. She hesitates and bumps up against a little table that makes a small noise. The couple on the sofa come out of their embrace and look up. The man is Sandro; the woman is the girl from Messina. Sandro looks at Claudia as though he were filled with terror. The girl, instead, seems quite amused. Claudia remains for a moment, staring at them as if she can't believe her own eyes, and is incapable of making any move. Then, she abruptly turns away and starts running. She runs through the main hall, the reception room, the courtyard, and out into the street. There is not a soul to be seen. No sound. The day is breaking clear and serene. Claudia comes over to a bench with its paint all peeling off, but she doesn't sit down. Transfixed, and with her eyes almost wide open, she stares out at the sea, and at the waves which are also a mystery unto themselves. Footsteps are heard approaching from behind, but Claudia doesn't even bother to turn. It seems that nothing could distract her from that painful state of shock which is written all over her face. A young laborer in overalls, carrying a small bundle under his arm, passes by, glancing at her with a look of curiosity. He walks a few paces ahead, then turns around to look at her again as though she were some kind of strange creature. The sound of footsteps dies down in the distance, and everything is silent once more. There is only the gentle lapping of the waves as they roll up against the shore. Claudia is completely oblivious to the scene. Several birds swoop down emitting their small cries. A sudden but almost imperceptible sea breeze ripples Claudia's hair. Other footsteps are heard approaching: slow, heavy. Claudia is still not stirred from her thoughtful, trance-like state. The footsteps come to a halt directly behind her. It is Sandro. He appears thoroughly crestfallen. He doesn't even have enough courage to look at Claudia. His face is worn and disfigured, like that of a tired old man. And he lets himself fall limp onto the bench. They both remain completely motionless, without looking at each other. And detached: Claudia standing, Sandro seated. Behind them, the skeleton of cement. Further off, the sea. Gradually, Claudia turns her head towards Sandro. Her eyes are filled with tears. She looks down upon him as though he were something that greatly pained her. She moves up closer to the bench. Sandro doesn't budge an inch. Claudia reaches out to him with her hand, then slowly, gently, and with an overwhelming sense of desperation, she caresses his hair.
