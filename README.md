## Text mining movie scripts to perform the Bechdel test using spaCy


The Bechdel test is a measure of representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man.  
Within the framework of this project I used text mining techniques on 1500+ movie scripts that I downloaded/parsed from the internet to explore long-term trend of female representation in movies by performing the test on them.
